Recommended Knowledge
=====================

Administrators
--------------
We recommend that a person within each organisation should be designated as the tool and database administrator. This person should:

* Have an understanding and experience of IT systems management.
* Understand relational database structures.
* Be an expert user of the chosen database system.
* Have qualifications, certified training or equivalent experience in managing databases using that system.
* Have certified training or equivalent experience in advanced features of the relevant GIS software, including defining, joining and exporting layers and creating spatial and attribute indexes.

Users
-----
A user guide is also available on ReadTheDocs at `readthedocs.org/projects/hlutool-userguide <https://readthedocs.org/projects/hlutool-userguide/>`_ for those who will be regular users of the HLU Tool but are not concerned with how to install or configure the tool or how to perform database administration.
