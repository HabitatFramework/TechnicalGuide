Data Tables
===========

Tables in the database prefixed by 'incid' are **data** tables and hence contain all the attribute data relating to the GIS features. The attributes have been separated into 8 tables to 'normalise' the data which reduces storage space, improves performance and provides greater flexibility.

.. sidebar:: Key to Data Tables

	1. incid
	2. incid_ihs_matrix
	3. incid_ihs_formation
	4. incid_ihs_management

.. _lookup_tables:

Lookup Tables
=============

Tables in the database prefixed by 'lut\_' are **lookup** tables and are used in many drop-down lists in the user interfaces to restrict choices to only valid or appropriate values for the organisation.

Some of the lookup tables contain records and settings that are generic to all HLU Tool installations and hence should be considered as 'system' records (indicated by the **system_supplied** attribute set to 'True' (minus one). These records are configured centrally and updates are applied to HLU Tool installations using the HLUDbUpdater.exe tool (see :doc:`../updater/updater` for more details). The remaining lookup tables can be configured for a given HLU Tool installation to tailor them to the specific requirements of each organisation.

	.. note::

		* Changes to the lookup tables won't take effect for HLU Tool instances that are running. The HLU Tool will need to be closed and re-started before any lookup table changes to take effect.
		* Lookup table values are relevant to the **whole** database system and hence any changes will affect **all** users of that database.
		* **All** records in tables containing a 'sort_order' attribute must have a numerical value set or they may not appear in the relevant drop-down lists.

.. seealso::
	See :Ref:`configuring_luts` for more information on configuring lookup tables.

The following lookup tables can be updated to tailor local requirements:

.. index::
	single: Lookup Tables; lut_Users

.. _lut_users:

lut_users
---------

This table contains details of all the users that have editing capability with the HLU Tool and indicates if they are also able to perform 'bulk' updates.

	user_id
		The user's *Windows* login ID. If the user logs in to a domain then the login should be entered in the format: *[Domain]\\[LoginID]*. [1]_

	user_name
		The name which will be displayed in the 'By' fields of the INCID section and the History tab.

	bulk_update
		Determines whether the user has permissions to run a bulk update to change attributes for all selected records. Ticking this checkbox gives the user permission to run bulk updates.

	sort_order
		Determines the order user names would be displayed in any relevant drop-down. This field is not currently used (as there are no drop-down lists that display users.)

	.. caution::
		Bulk update permission should only be assigned to **expert** users and should only be used with caution as mistakes can have major affects on the data.

.. [1] The 'user_id' of the current user is shown in the **Tools... --> About** window.

.. index::
	single: Lookup Tables; Sort Order
	single: Lookup Tables; Local Flags

Local Flags & Sort Orders
-------------------------

Regardless of whether records in a lookup table are 'system' supplied records or not, many can be configured to indicate if they are applicable to an organisation. For example, many lookup tables contain a **sort_order** field that will determine the order that the values appear in any related drop-down lists. Some tables also have a **is_local** field that can be used to 'hide' values that are not applicable to the local area or should not be used by the organisation.

	is_local
		Set to 'True' (minus 1) to include in drop-down lists, or 'False' (zero) to exclude from drop-down lists.

	sort_order
		Set to a sequential, positive numeric whole number to indicate the order records should appear in drop-down lists. Alternatively all records can be set to zero to use the default sort order for that table.

	.. note::

		* Changes to the lookup tables won't take effect for HLU Tool instances that are running. The HLU Tool will need to be closed and re-started before any lookup table changes to take effect.
		* Lookup table values are relevant to the **whole** database system and hence any changes will affect **all** users of that database.
		* **All** records in tables containing a 'sort_order' attribute must have a numerical value set or they may not appear in the relevant drop-down lists.

The following lookup tables can be updated to tailor their **is_local** and/or **sort_order** values:

	lut_ihs_habitat
		Contains all the IHS Habitats that can be assigned to INCIDs using the 'Habitat' field on the Habitats tab of the main window.

.. _export_tables:

Export Tables
=============

Tables in the database prefixed by 'export' are **export** tables and are used to define different formats that can be used to export data from the HLU Tool database and GIS layers to a new 'standalone' GIS layer.

.. seealso::
	See :ref:`configuring_exports` for more information.


.. index::
	single: Export Tables; exports

.. _exports:

exports
-------

This table lists all the export 'formats' that can be used when exporting data.

	export_id
		A unique identifier used to determines which fields are selected from the 'exports_fields' table.

	export_name
		The name which will be displayed in the 'Export Format' drop-down list.

Once a new export format has been added to the 'exports' table the fields to be included in the export must be added to the 'exports_fields' table.

.. index::
	single: Export Tables; exports_fields

.. _exports_fields:

exports_fields
--------------

.. sidebar:: Excluded Fields

	* GIS controlled fields such as obj, shape, perimeter, area, x, y, etc. should not be included. These fields will be automatically added to the exported layer.
	* Fields already in the active GIS layer (e.g. toid, toid_fragment_id, ihs_category, ihs_summary) are automatically included in the exported layer and hence should not be added to the exports_fields table.

This table defines which fields are to be exported for each export format in the 'exports' table. It also defines what the export fields will be called, the order they will appear in the new GIS layer and the number of occurrences of each field (where fields can appear in multiple table records.)

	export_field_id
		A unique identifier for the field.

	export_id
		The unique identifier for the export type in the 'exports' table (see :ref:`exports`).

	table_name
		The name of the source table in the database containing the column to be exported.

	column_name
		The name of the column within the source table.

	column_ordinal
		The number of the column within the source table starting from 1. The export function does not require this column to be completed.

	field_name
		The name of the column in the exported GIS layer. The 'field_name' must be a valid ArcGIS/MapInfo column name (i.e. containing no spaces or special characters.)

	.. caution::
		When exporting to an ArcGIS shapefile field names must be less than 10 characters or they will be truncated or renamed by ArcGIS.

	field_ordinal
		Sets the order of the fields in the exported GIS layer.

	field_count
		Allows users to set the number of child records to be exported. Fields from the incid table do not support field_count values as there is only ever one incid record for an incid.

	field_type
		Allows users to set the data type of the field to be exported.

			|         99 | AutoNumber        | Integer field that automatically increments with each row. |
			+------------+-------------------+------------------------------------------------------------+

	field_length
		Allows users to set the maximum length of text fields. Text input values longer than this length will be truncated during the export without warning.

		.. note::
			field_length is only used where the field_type is '10' (text), otherwise it is ignored.
	
	field_format
		Allows users to determine the format of the exported field. See :ref:`export_field_formats` for more details on which export fields can be formatted and how to format them.

Table Relationships
===================

There are 52 tables in the HLU Tool relational database comprised of data tables, lookup tables and export tables. The relationships between the tables are too numerous and complex to display in a single diagram so the tables and relationships have therefore been separated into 7 logical groups, some of which connect and overlap with one another.

.. tip::
	Bespoke relationship diagrams between the various HLU Tool tables can be created using SQL Server Management Studio.
