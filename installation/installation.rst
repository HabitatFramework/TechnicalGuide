	Hard disk space requirements are given as a guideline. The actual amount of disk space required will depend upon the size of the GIS layers and database files. In addition to these files space is required for temporary files during processing.

**Minimum specification:**

	* 4 Gb RAM
	* 3 Gb available hard disk space

**Recommended specification:**

	* 3 GHz Dual Core PC

Installing the HLU Tool
=======================

To install the HLU Tool `double-click` on the Setup.exe and follow the instructions. By default this will install the HLU Tool into the :file:`C:\\Program Files\\HLU\\HLU GIS Tool\\` directory and will optionally display the ReadMe file. The installer will also create two shortcuts in the start menu:

	* **HLU Tool - Launch** - this will start the tool
	* **HLU Tool - Reconfigure** - this will start the tool using the **/c** switch parameter. See :doc:`../configuration/configuration` for details of how to connect to a HLU Tool database and GIS application.
